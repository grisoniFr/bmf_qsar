# BIOMAP 
### (Biomagnification Factor prediction)

## Welcome to the BIOMAP webbpage

This repository contains data related to the BIOMAP project.
The project aims to develop *in silico* machine learning methods to predict the bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms through dietary routes, to increase the mechanistic understanding and to reduce animal testing. 


### Information

The data collected in this repository were manually curated, as follows:
* **KOW**
* **BCF**
* **BMF**
