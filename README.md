# BMF_QSAR
*In silico Biomagnification Factor prediction project*

## Welcome!

This repository contains material for the prediction of the Biomagnification Factor (BMF) of organic chemicals in fish by Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) methods.

Reference paper: Grisoni, F., Consonni, V., Vighi, M. (2018): "Acceptable-by-design QSARs to predict the dietary biomagnification of organic chemicals in fish", Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management" (IEAM), just accepted.

### Information

From this webpage, you can have access to two types of material: 
* **logBMF dataset**: containing experimental BMF values, SMILES strings, computed molecular descriptors, predicted/calculated values for 214 organic chemicals, available [here](https://github.com/grisoniFr/bmf_qsar/tree/master/data). 
* **BMF_pred software**: to apply the models described in the original paper. Software freely available for non-commercial use at Alvascience [download link](http://www.alvascience.com/bmfpred/).

For more details on the dataset see [Grisoni et al., 2018, *Chemosphere*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653518310087).
