# BMF_QSAR
*Biomagnification Factor prediction*

## Welcome!

This repository contains data related to the prediction of the Biomagnification Factor (BMF) of organic chemicals in fish by Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) methods.

### Information

From this webpage, you can have access to two types of material: 
* **logBMF dataset**: containing BMF values and molecular descriptors, available [here]. 
* **BMF_QSAR software**: to apply the models described in Grisoni et al., 2018b.

For more details see [Grisoni et al., 2018, Chemosphere]([link here]).
